<p>A FUSE filesystem that tracks video file viewings and logs them to a SQLite database. I built it to learn more about
    SQLite as well as
    filesystems and how they interact with userspace applications.

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Allows read-only access to video files in configured library path within mountpoint</li>
    <li>Logs film title, times watched, and last watched timestamp in ~/.filmfs/films.db</li>
    <li>Inspect logs with Qt-based GUI <a href="https://github.com/nniemeir/filmfs" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>watchlistViewer</i></a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
<p>I learned that media players often perform multiple read operations during a single viewing of a file. If each read
    were
    logged independently, the watch count would be incremented multiple times per viewing. To address this, I stored the
    PID
    of the last read operation in a static variable initialized to -1 (since valid PIDs are non-negative). New reads are
    only logged if the current PID is not the same as the last one.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
Automated testing is planned for the next iteration, this document will be updated at that point.

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>While I already knew some basic SQL from a course I'd taken centered around Chuck Easttom's <i>Network Defense And
        Countermeasures</i>, this project taught me a lot about the basics of working with databases programmatically
    via
    SQLite.</p>
<p>This project deepened my knowledge of the POSIX filesystem API, but was not quite as challenging as I would have
    liked.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p>
    While FUSE abstracts much of the complexity of filesystem development, I plan to challenge myself by writing a
    kernel-level filesystem in the future to gain a more complete understanding of low-level I/O operations.
