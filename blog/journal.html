    warrant a full post on their own.</p>

<h4><strong>August 20th, 2025:</strong> Audio Permissions In Qt Creator Flatpak</h4>
<p><em>Tags: #development, #foss, #qt</em></p>
<p>Running a project with audio in the Qt Creator flatpak (<i>io.qt.QtCreator</i>) will result in a "No audio device
    detected" message in the application output by default: this is because permission must be manually granted for the
    program to access
    the PulseAudio sound server via Flatseal or by running the following command.</p>
<pre class="code-block">
flatpak override io.qt.QtCreator --user --socket=pulseaudio
</pre>

<h4><strong>August 19th, 2025:</strong> GPS Permissions On Custom Android ROMs</h4>
<p><em>Tags: #adb, #android, #foss, #gps</em></p>
<p>Unlike stock Android, custom ROMs like Lineage do not give Google Mobile Services (GMS) location permissions by
    default. These permissions can be enabled by running the following commands.</p>
<pre class="code-block">
adb shell pm grant com.google.android.gms android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
    
adb shell pm grant com.google.android.gms android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
</pre>

<h4><strong>August 14th, 2025:</strong> Proprietary Firmware on Fedora Linux</h4>
<p><em>Tags: #fedora, #firmware, #foss, #linux</em></p>
<p>Fedora has adopted a stricter stance on including proprietary software in the standard repositories in the past two
    years. RPM fusion free and non-free repos often need to be enabled by following the steps outlined in <a

        rel="noopener noreferrer">Fedora's documentation</a> to ensure
    proper hardware support.</p>
