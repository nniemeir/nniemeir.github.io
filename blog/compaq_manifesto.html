   <h1>The Compaq Manifesto</h1>
   <h3>Date: 2025-12-28</h3>
   <p>It's been a minute. After five years of striving to transfer into a university, I finally got into a Computer
      Science BS
      program. I was happier than I'd ever been when I arrived, and more
      miserable than I'd ever been by the end of the first month. Between tuition, living costs, and the need to work 20
      hours a week to get by, the situation just wasn't sustainable long-term and I made the difficult decision to move
      back around Halloween this year.</p>
   <p>Since I already have an IT AAS and learn best through hands-on experience, I
      decided to return to my hometown to progress my career through self-teaching and work experience rather than a
      Bachelor's degree. The experience dampened my
      passion for about a month after getting home, but reflecting on the path that led here has helped me
      reclaim
      it.</p>

   <h2>The Compaq Presario CQ56</h2>
   <p>My sister and I got our first computer when I was 10 (2011), a used Compaq Presario CQ56:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD V-Series V140 (Single core, 2.3 GHz)</li>
      <li><strong>GPU:</strong> ATI Radeon HD 4250</li>
      <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 2GB DDR3</li>
      <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows 7</li>
      <li><strong>HDD Rotational Speed:</strong> 5400 RPM</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Not exactly a powerhouse. On every boot, I'd be greeted by a friendly message:</p>
   <pre class="code-block">
HP Battery Alert

The system has detected the storage capacity of the battery stated below to be very low. For optimal performance, this 
battery may need to be replaced
</pre>

   <p>A bad battery that equated to about 30 seconds of life when not plugged in, lots of running when we needed to move
      from
      one part of the house to another.</p>

   <p>Our upgrade budget: $0.00</p>

   <h2>Malware & Other Sins</h2>
   <p>As with most kids, my sister and I were pretty naive with the internet. Within a month of us having the laptop, we
      had
      accumulated our share of desktop adware and so many browser toolbars that you could hardly see the viewing area. I
      realized that most of these came from our use of tools like Softonic Downloader, which would encourage the user to
      download adware along with the intended program. This prompted me to learn how to uninstall programs through the
      control
      panel, but this was not quite enough. Some of these unwanted programs didn't actually uninstall when the
      uninstaller
      was
      run, and had to be manually deleted from 'Program Files (x86)' or %APPDATA% ($HOME\AppData\Roaming).</p>

   <p>Due to the limited resources of the laptop, realtime virus scanners would have crippled performance. Tools like
      Norton would hook a number of syscalls related to process creation and file access among other things: this often
      slowed low end systems to a crawl.</p>
   <p>Instead, I opted to run a Malwarebytes scan each morning that I used the
      laptop.
   </p>

   <p>In the
      Windows
      7 era, vendor bloatware was at its peak. This model fortunately shipped with only a few optional HP services and
      practically no trialware, so there wasn't much to remove. </p>

   <h2>Squeezing Blood From A Stone</h2>
   <p>Like most children, I enjoyed excessively violent crime games like <i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i> and <i>Saints Row
         The
         Third</i>: things that this fossil had no business running. On my first attempt, I wasn't even cracking double
      digit FPS. I have never been someone to be deterred by petty
      things like reality, so I insisted that I could get console level performance out of these titles with enough
      effort.
   </p>

   <h3>Trimming The Fat</h3>
   <p>It is not controversial to say that Windows includes a lot of nonessential services for the average user. Since we
      only used the machine for web browsing and gaming,
      there were plenty of operating system services that we could disable:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Superfetch:</strong> This service tried to predict what applications the user is likely to open and
         preload them into RAM. On slow drives, an absolute performance nightmare.</li>
      <li><strong>Windows Search:</strong> Handles searches in the start menu, file explorer, and Outlook. This service
         constantly indexed files in the background, which was not helpful to performance on slow HDDs.</li>
      <li><strong>Print Spooler:</strong> Manages print jobs</li>
      <li><strong>HomeGroup Provider:</strong> HomeGroup was a feature introduced in Windows 7 to share files and
         printer access over a LAN.</li>
      <li><strong>ehRecvr:</strong> Handled TV tuners for Windows Media Center</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Preventing Startup From Lasting The Length Of The Godfather Trilogy</h3>
   <p>Among other things, the System Configuration utility (msconfig) in Windows can be used to manage startup
      applications. In my experience, most applications that want to launch on startup don't actually need to and can be
      omitted to lessen boot times.</p>

   <h3>Task Priority</h3>
   <p>Tasks at higher priority levels are scheduled before lower priority ones when competing for CPU time,
      similar to Linux niceness. The priority level for a task can be set in the task manager. The highest priority
      level,
      Realtime, should not be used for games as it gives the process
      precedence over most system threads: this often causes instability.</p>

   <h3>Virtual Memory</h3>
   <p>This laptop was quite prone to hanging and crashing when running intensive applications like browsers, which I
      attributed to the meager 2GB RAM. When RAM fills, Windows moves inactive memory pages to a file (pagefile.sys) on
      the
      drive
      containing the operating system. This is very similar to how Swap memory functions on Unix operating systems.
      Since it lived on an HDD, SSDs were rare at the time, the
      pagefile was considerably slower than RAM itself.</p>
   <p>Windows expands the pagefile as needed by default, but needing
      to
      allocate disk space to grow it could be painfully slow. For this reason, many users with only 1-2GB RAM would set
      the
      pagefile to a fixed size of 1.5 or 2 times their RAM size. Due to improvements in memory management on Windows and
      higher average RAM, letting Windows manage the pagefile is sufficient.</p>


   <h3>Visual Settings</h3>
   <p>Windows Aero was a much more massive resource hog than consumers anticipated, and one of the first steps to
      improving performance on a low spec PC in the 2000s was to disable it
      by switching to the non-Aero theme <i>Windows Classic</i>. I believed at the time that the uglier something
      looked, the better it would run: Linux would teach me otherwise in the following year.</p>

   <p>Additional performance-affecting compositor features that can be disabled are found in the Visual Effects settings
      under
      Advanced System Settings. I have always opted to disable all except the following:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Show thumbnails instead of icons</li>
      <li>Show window contents while dragging</li>
      <li>Smooth edges of screen fonts</li>
   </ul>

   <figure>
      <img src="../images/windows-classic.webp"
         alt="Image of Windows Classic Theme on Windows 7">
      <figcaption>Windows Classic Theme</figcaption>
   </figure>
   <p>I also chose to uncheck 'Show Desktop Icons' under the view section of the desktop context menu. This is
      insignificant
      on modern hardware, but I was already dealing with around 3 minute startup time and wanted any way to reduce it.
   </p>

   <h3>Defragmentation</h3>
   <p>For a variety of reasons, a file might not be stored in one contiguous piece on disk. Defragmentation is the
      process of reorganizing files back into contiguous blocks and consolidating free space. This doesn't matter much
      on flash memory like SSDs, but on HDDs this meant that the read head had to jump around to read a single file,
      which reduced speed.</p>

   <h3>Disk Cleanup</h3>
   <p>On HDDs, having a nearly full hard drive leads to performance degradation and instability: Microsoft has included
      a
      remedy for this since Windows 98. The Disk Cleanup utility provides an interface to free disk space by deleting
      potentially unwanted
      files,
      including:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Temporary files used by applications (usually stored in $HOME\AppData\Local\Temp)</li>
      <li>Cached files from updates</li>
      <li>Diagnostic files generated from Windows errors</li>
      <li>Old System Restore points, the cleanup option here deletes all but the most recent restore point</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>CCleaner & Performing Conscious Heart Surgery</h3>
   <p>Windows has stored its low-level configuration values in a hierarchical database called the Registry since
      Windows
      3.1. Some programs that modify the registry on installation do not undo those modifications when they are
      uninstalled, leaving orphaned keys. Piriform's CCleaner was a popular utility that included functionality for
      removing these orphaned keys, but Microsoft themselves have warned against using such programs as you're more
      likely
      to break your Windows install by accidentally deleting something important than get any noticeable performance
      increase. A lot of low end PC users made use of this back in the day, but just don't.</p>

   <h3>Preventing Housefires</h3>
   <p>Anyone who has run intensive tasks on a laptop knows they can get exceptionally hot, this model of Compaq was no
      exception. CPUs and GPUs are designed to throttle performance when temperature begins exceeding safe bounds, which
      is something I couldn't afford with the poor performance I was already getting. Luckily, I got a hold of a cheap
      cooling pad that limited temperatures from scorching to smoldering and
      would intentionally game in the coldest room of the house.</p>

   </figure>

   <h2>STILL.NOT.ENOUGH</h2>
   <p>After all of that effort, I was still getting around 13 FPS in <i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i> at lowest settings. It
      is
      important to note that this PC port is considered one of the worst in gaming history thanks to a long list of
      issues. The original release of the game, the version I had, had an unstable DRM implementation via Games For
      Windows Live which was a
      common cause of crashes. It also ran notoriously bad on hardware of the time due to being heavily CPU bound and
      early versions of Rockstar's RAGE engine being developed with Xbox 360 architecture in mind. The texture streaming
      implementation was particularly poor, with stuttering and texture pop-in often occurring when driving vehicles in
      the game. The game also prevented users from configuring graphical settings that would need more VRAM than their
      GPU had, this could be helpful if it wasn't so bad at detecting VRAM capacity. During my research at the time, I
      discovered that
      the game's graphical settings could be further
      modified by creating a file called commandline.txt in the base directory. This is around the time where my
      family began questioning my sanity. This is what my commandline.txt looked like at the time:</p>
   <pre class="code-block">
# Set quality as low as possible
-renderquality 0 
-shadowdensity 0
-texturequality 0
-viewdistance 0
-detailquality 0
# Disable VSync
-novblank
# Force low resolution 
-width 640
-height 480
-fullscreen
# Force the engine to use 100% of the VRAM it thinks we have
-percentvidmem 100
# Use the less intensive audio pipeline
-minspecaudio
# Disable memory allocation limits
-nomemrestrict
      </pre>

   <p>This got average FPS up from 13 to around 25 consistently, which was just fine by my child self's standards.
      Interestingly, I didn't play the game all that much once I got it performing decently: it was the research and
      optimization that stimulated me.</p>

   <p>Note: A substantial amount of work has been put in by fans to reduce glitches and improve the performance and
      visual
      quality of the game through projects like Fusion Fix in recent years, which I hope is as inspiring to others as it
      is to me.</p>

   <h2>What's The Point?</h2>
   <p><i>"We learn from failure, not from success!</i> - Bram Stoker</p>
   <p>My passion for engineering came from being handed hard constraints, understanding systems well enough to operate
      within them, and iterating until I was satisfied with the result; a mindset that I have heard echoed by other
      people in STEM. It was that same passion, not financial incentive or guidance from others, that led me to study
      the fields I have in computing;cybersecurity, devops, POSIX APIs, and identity management systems like Active
      Directory and RHEL's Identity Management Service.</p>

   <h2>Continuation</h2>
   <p>After this Compaq, I had an even weaker Acer Aspire One. That is where Linux comes in.</p>
