### About Linux From Scratch
  GNU/Linux distributions are defined in large part by their package manager: these are programs that handle the
  installation, updating, and configuration of other programs on the host. Linux From Scratch is a book that
  teaches the reader a way to compile a functional GNU/Linux operating system without the use of such a program.
  The reader is left with an
  operating system akin to a base install of Arch Linux at the end of the project, and that is where the sequel
  that I intend to cover at a later date comes in.

### Why I Recommend The Project
LFS can provide users with a greater understanding of: the standards that LFS is structured around, what functionality each program within the project adds to an operating system, how cross-compilation is achieved, and how they might troubleshoot compilation and configuration errors.

### Advice On Undertaking The Project

* You should begin LFS with at least a basic knowledge of the GNU Core Utilities, disk partitioning, and
            common network protocols.
* I cannot stress this enough, read each page carefully to ensure that you are actually taking in the information: it is easy to just copy and paste the commands for each section, but you
            will have learned far less by doing so.
* The amount of time that it will take you to complete the project is dependent on your hardware and level
of experience, so don't
assume that a given user's install time is an indication of their competence or otherwise.
* LFS requires you to install one of two init systems, SysVinit or Systemd, the latter is more commonly used in modern distributions but you are more likely to find support for the former due to its age.
* If you are using a distribution that utilizes SELinux on your host operating system, you are likely to encounter an error
when compiling Attr; if you are certain that the host will not be connected to the internet going forward,
you can resolve this issue by disabling SELinux and erasing the attributes it has assigned to each object in
your filesystem.
* Setting the LFS variable within the primary user and root account's .bash_profile or .bashrc as explained
  in [Section 2.6](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter02/aboutlfs.html) can save you a lot of time, as I have seen a fair amount of readers damage their host by referencing the
  variable in a command without it being set.
*  LFS does not carry over the MAKEFLAGS variable, which specifies how many jobs can be running at the same
  time, when we enter the chroot environment: compile times can be greatly improved by reapplying the
  MAKEFLAGS variable or specifying -jx (where x is the number of threads available) in each make command.
*  If you are installing LFS in a virtualized environment, you may have to specify the UUID and PARTUUID of
  your
  root partition in your grub.cfg as explained in [Section 10.4.4](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter10/grub.html) to avoid boot failure.
* Though there are some brave souls in the FOSS community who use LFS as their primary operating system, doing so is often discouraged due
  to the complexities of upgrading the GNU C Library explained in [Section 8.2.1](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter08/pkgmgt.html).
