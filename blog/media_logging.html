<h1>On Media Consumption & Logging</h1>
<h3>Date: 2025-10-31</h3>
<h2>Why Log Media Consumption?</h2>
<p>Memory is fickle, most of us have struggled to remember what we've read, watched, played, or listened to. I believe
    that
    our memory of things is often the only proof that they actually happened, and many Americans spend hours of their
    lives
    engaging with the arts that it seems a waste to let any of it be entirely forgotten. Logging our engagement also
    makes
    it easier to analyze our media engagement in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Find common patterns in media that we are drawn to</li>
    <li>Recommend media to others based on common themes</li>
    <li>For arts students and professionals: have a larger repository to pull from when writing about the arts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges To Logging Media Consumption</h2>
<p>Recommendation algorithms and platform policies can have a profound effect on our media consumption and how we engage
    with the world.
    Media streaming and curation platforms choose to delete content from their databases often, as is their right. This
    presents a problem for those wishing to
    fully log their media engagement or engage with the arts on their own terms: when content is removed, your history
    goes with it.</p>
<h2>My Approach</h2>
<p>My solution to this problem is as simple as it gets, a set of CSV files that I keep in a private Git repository.
    Using CSV files keeps logging portable, versionable, and easily searchable.</p>
<ul>
    <li>books.csv - Books that I've read (103 entries)</li>
    <li>channels.csv - active channels on various platforms whose content I enjoy (48 entries)</li>
    <li>childrens_books.csv - Children's and YA books that I've read (81 entries)</li>
    <li>comics.csv - Graphic novels that I've read (686 entries)</li>
    <li>games.csv - Games that I've completed (365 entries)</li>
    <li>music.csv - Albums I've listened to (1267 entries)</li>
    <li>TBL.csv - Albums that I've been recommended (435 entries)</li>
    <li>TBR.csv - Books that I've been recommended (77 entries)</li>
</ul>

<p>A luxury of CSV files and spreadsheets is that it is entirely up to the individual what each field represents: mine
    are not particularly elaborate, but there is infinite room for expansion.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>I delimit fields with a semicolon instead of a comma because a significant number of titles include commas.</p>
<h3>books.csv, childrens_books.csv, & comics.csv</h3>
<p>Title;Author(s);Genre;Date
    </br>Moby Dick;Herman Melville;Adventure;08/12/2022</p>

<h2>Escaping The Noise</h2>
<p>The internet was once a haven for hyperspecific communities, but it has been drifting further and further towards
    black box recommendation algorithms that push the statistically safest content.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the problem is corporate ownership itself—private companies can run however they like—but the
    vendor lock-in that follows. Your watch history, your playlists, even the fact that you read a book can be erased
    overnight.</p>

<p>The current era often feels like a blur of content and messaging from every conceivable corner of society.
    There is not a realistic way to avoid this noise entirely, but I've found a few methods that help control it.</p>

<h3>Discovering New Media</h3>
Instead of relying on algorithms to find new music, I follow labels directly through their website if they have one or
their Bandcamp if they do not. I find new labels and standout albums by checking the top posts on genre subreddits about
twice a year and interacting with people at record stores. I apply the same approach to literature.

<h3>YouTube Playlists</h3>
Rather than using YouTube playlists that require a Google account (which results in targeted recommendations), I copy
the links to each video (one per line) into a file which I save with the extension m3u, which can be played with MPV as
a playlist (provided you have yt-dlp installed).

<h3>Channels</h3>
Most streaming services (e.g. Twitch, YouTube) provide RSS feeds for the channels they host, allowing you to centralize
your feed without the intrusion of recommendation algorithms or advertisements. I personally like Fluent Reader (GUI)
and Newsboat (CLI).
