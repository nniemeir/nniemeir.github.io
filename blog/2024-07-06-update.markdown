### What I've Been Doing

In fall of 2023, I undertook a capstone project for my AAS in Cybersecurity in which I deployed and hardened virtual machines representing enterprise networks under the Microsoft and Red Hat ecosystems. After receiving positive feedback on the project, I decided to further develop my deployment scripts and documentation to be in a more readable format. This is an ongoing project whose progress can be tracked on its Git repository.
