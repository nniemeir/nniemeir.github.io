<h1>NVIDIA on Fedora</h1>
<h3>Date: 2025-08-22</h3>
<p>If you installed Fedora on a system with an NVIDIA GPU, you will have reduced graphics performance
    out of the box: the reasons for that are fairly simple. Fedora Linux
    ships a FOSS driver for NVIDIA GPUs called <b>nouveau</b>, developed through some clever reverse
    engineering work beginning in 2005: this was necessary due to NVIDIA's decision not to fully open-source their GPU
    drivers.</p>

<h2>Why Nouveau Doesn't Always Cut It</h2>
<p>Nouveau is operating at a disadvantage due to limited access to hardware internals, which results in noticeably worse
    performance and lack of certain features that the user may require (e.g. CUDA). For example, <i>Batman: Arkham
        Knight</i> only gave me 25% of the framerate I achieved on the proprietary driver running on a GTX 1650: this is
    insufficient for users that wish to maximize performance for their hardware.</p>

<h2>Installing NVIDIA's Proprietary Drivers On Fedora</h2>
<p>It is advised to follow
    RPM Fusion's <a href="https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide</a> to
    install the
    proprietary drivers.</p>
<p>On the Fedora Sway spin, which drops GNOME in favor of Sway window manager there's one more step. The Sway development team has made it very clear
    that they will not debug issues relating to proprietary GPU drivers, and by default, Sway refuses to launch with
    them. To bypass this, you
    must run Sway with the --unsupported-gpu option set. I opted to alias sway
    like so in my POSIX-like shell configuration :</p>
<pre class="code-block">
alias sway='sway --unsupported-gpu'
</pre>
