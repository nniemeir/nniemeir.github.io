<p>I'm a 23 year old first year Computer Science student based in the United States. While earning my AAS in
    Cybersecurity, I
    found myself increasingly drawn to operating systems and low level software development. This interest led me to
    study
    POSIX API programming and Linux internals during my prerequisite coursework. I enjoy building software that
    interacts directly with the OS-my first projects in that arena being a basic kernel module, a shell implementation,
    and a FUSE filesystem. Over the next year, I plan to deepen my understanding of low-level programming and begin
    exploring reverse engineering.
