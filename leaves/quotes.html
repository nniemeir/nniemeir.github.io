    <h1>Film Quotes That Have Stuck With Me</h1>
    <h3>December 31st, 2025</h3>
    <p>Of all aspects of film as an art form, none drew me to the medium more than its unique way of challenging the way
        that we look at the world. These are a few quotes that have meant the most to me over the years.</p>

    <blockquote>"I don't know what I've been doing with my life all these years." - Man 1<br>"We only realize how
        beautiful
        life is
        when we chance upon death" - Man 2</blockquote>
    <p><em>Ikiru (1952). Directed by Akira Kurosawa</em></p>
    <p>This film has remained in my yearly Christmas rotation and I consider this exchange to be its thesis on
        purposeful living with the time that we are afforded.</p>

    <blockquote>"I feel my life turning. All it needed was a direction. You drift from day to day, years go by. Then a
        change
        comes. I am able to change. I can be a good person. What a strange thing to happen, halfway through your
        life. What luck."</blockquote>
    <p><em>Light Sleeper (1992). Directed by Paul Schrader</em></p>
    <p>Paul Schrader's moody 3AM midlife crisis flick never fails to give me hope on each viewing that redemption isn't
        out
        of reach for any of us that are willing to acknowledge our mistakes.</p>

    <blockquote>"I can't afford the luxury of anger. Anger can make me vulnerable. It can destroy my reason and reason's
        the
        only advantage I have over them"</blockquote>
    <p><em>The Last Man On Earth (1964). Directed by Ubaldo Ragona & Sidney Salkow</em></p>
    <p>My personal favorite adaptation of Richard Matheson's survival horror novel <i>I Am Legend</i>, speaking to the
        very human urge to use intellectualism as armor.</p>

    <blockquote>"It's what people know about themselves inside that makes 'em afraid"</blockquote>
    <p><em>High Plains Drifter (1973). Directed by Clint Eastwood</em></p>
    <p>From Eastwood's supernatural revenge western, a reminder to consider how much of our reactions to external events
        are based on our own anxieties.</p>

    <blockquote>"Some men you see every day for ten years and you never notice; some men you see once and they're with
        you for
        the rest of your life."</blockquote>
    <p><em>3:10 to Yuma (1957). Directed by Delmer Daves</em></p>
    <p>I have always taken this line as prompting viewers to be observant about the people who have an impact on our
        lives and
        appreciate them while we still can.</p>
